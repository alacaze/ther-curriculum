# Therapeutics curriculum

The Pharmacy Practice and Medicines Management stream is working to develop a therapeutics curriculum for use throughout the program.


## Objectives

* Determine a list of key disease states that students are expected to know well; the idea is that these are the 80% conditions: common conditions that students will encounter and need to be able to contribute to therapeutic decisions in relation to
* Provide clarity regarding when the disease is taught in the program and who teaches the condition
* Support consistent and comprehensive assessment in relation to the conditions. The curriculum would allow the School to demonstrate that students have demonstrated knowledge and skills in these conditions throughout the program


## Plan


1. Adopt ACCP Pharmacotherapy Didactic Curriculum 2023 (Kolanczyk et al. 2024).  Adapt as appropriate for our context.
2. Map our current teaching against the curriculum
3. Identify learning objectives for all (or most) Tier 1 and Tier 2 conditions
4. Develop automatically marked questions for all learning objectives
2. Each Pharmacy Practice and Medicines Management course includes a hurdle therapeutics exam (~ 20%). 

## ACCP curriculum

The ACCP curriculum provides a list of 231 conditions from 23 systems ordered into three tiers.

The tiers are defined in the following ways

Tier 1
:   Students receive sufficient education and training on this condition to prepare them to be practice-ready pharmacists providing collaborative, person-centered care upon graduation and licensure

Tier 2
:   Students receive foundational education and training on this condition, but some additional knowledge and/or training will be required after graduation (e.g., residency, fellowship, or other experiences) to prepare them to be practice-ready pharmacists providing collaborative, person-centered care

Tier 3
:   Students receive limited education on this condition, and substantial knowledge or training will be required after graduation (e.g., residency, fellowship, or other experiences) to prepare them to provide collaborative, person-centered care

The `yaml` version of the database is [here](therapeutics-curriculum.yaml).


### Adapting the ACCP curriculum

So far we have made the decision not to modify the ACCP curriculum; i.e. retain the list of conditions, systems and tiers.

We do however want to adapt the curriculum in a couple of ways:

1. Recognise that some of our teaching might aim *higher* than the tier suggested by ACCP. We might teach and assess a Tier 2 condition at the Tier 1 level. We will  seek to note this where relevant.
2. Recognise that there are some Australian-specific conditions/contexts we need to cover. A good example is Indigenous Health priorities. We might seek to address these context-specific elements at the learning objective level.


## Identify learning objectives

Please work through the conditions for your course and provide learning objectives for any conditions covered in your course that are in Tier 1 or Tier 2.

Many conditions are covered in multiple courses, often at slightly different levels.

The learning objectives we want are the learning objectives we want students to have achieved at completion of the *program* (i.e. they are not course-specific). 

If a condition is covered in multiple courses, collaborate on the learning objectives.

The following general learning objectives might be helpful for thinking about the condition-specific learning objective: 

1. Be able to apply knowledge of the pathophysiology, prognosis, signs and symptoms and lived-experience of the condition
2. Be able to apply evidence and best-practice guidance regarding pharmacotherapy for the condition to individual patients
3. Be able to individualise pharmacotherapy for the condition to key patient groups
